      <description>Hi everyone!
This last week I decided to try Matt Kiely&amp;rsquo;s Malware Analysis course published on TCM Security. I have always been curious about the inner workings of malware and this was the perfect opportunity for me to finally fulfill this knowledge.
Overall the course was really well explained and the information really useful and to the point.
Some of the different subjects explained in the course were:
Basic Analysis Dynamic Analysis Decompiling Debugging Some specialty malware classes like shellcode, powershell, VBScript, C#, Go, Mobile malware, etc As a final course assignment we were tasked on writting a report on any of the malware samples we were provided as course material, so here is mine: https://github.</description>

&lt;p&gt;This last week I decided to try Matt Kiely&amp;rsquo;s Malware Analysis course published on TCM Security. I have always been curious about the inner workings of malware and this was the perfect opportunity for me to finally fulfill this knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the course was really well explained and the information really useful and to the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the different subjects explained in the course were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic Analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamic Analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decompiling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debugging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some specialty malware classes like shellcode, powershell, VBScript, C#, Go, Mobile malware, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final course assignment we were tasked on writting a report on any of the malware samples we were provided as course material, so here is mine:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JanDuinkerken/Malware-Analysis-Report&#34;&gt;https://github.com/JanDuinkerken/Malware-Analysis-Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested on this subject the first five hours of the course are availiable to watch for free on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA0YcYMRWyI&#34;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;, so go check them out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is a very good course and recommend it 100%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thats all for today, go check the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA0YcYMRWyI&#34;&gt;youtube video&lt;/a&gt; and have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Hello everyone! I am Jan Duinkerken Rodríguez, a Computer Engineering student based in A Coruña, Spain
My main interests are programming and cybersecurity, so espect to see a lot about those topics in this blog!
I am currently finishing my studies, but after that I plan on getting my masters in cybersecurity and trying to land a job in that field, even though I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mind working as a developer also.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone!
This post is mean to be an explanation on the different topics I&amp;rsquo;m going to write about and why I created this blog.
I really love coding and cybersecurity, so those are going to be the main topics off this blog, but I will probably also write some posts on linux ricing and the different tools/ programs I like to use for my day to day Computer Engineering studies and work.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason I created this blog was to document my studies and the different things I learn in the case they might be useful to someone in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all for this first post, see you all in the next weeks as I keep posting!&lt;/p&gt;
