      <description>Hi everyone!
This post is mean to be an explanation on the different topics I&amp;rsquo;m going to write about and why I created this blog.
I really love coding and cybersecurity, so those are going to be the main topics off this blog, but I will probably also write some posts on linux ricing and the different tools/ programs I like to use for my day to day Computer Engineering studies and work.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is mean to be an explanation on the different topics I&amp;rsquo;m going to write about and why I created this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really love coding and cybersecurity, so those are going to be the main topics off this blog, but I will probably also write some posts on linux ricing and the different tools/ programs I like to use for my day to day Computer Engineering studies and work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason I created this blog was to document my studies and the different things I learn in the case they might be useful to someone in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all for this first post, see you all in the next weeks as I keep posting!&lt;/p&gt;
