      <description>Hi everyone!
This last week I decided to try Matt Kiely&amp;rsquo;s Malware Analysis course published on TCM Security. I have always been curious about the inner workings of malware and this was the perfect opportunity for me to finally fulfill this knowledge.
Overall the course was really well explained and the information really useful and to the point.
Some of the different subjects explained in the course were:
Basic Analysis Dynamic Analysis Decompiling Debugging Some specialty malware classes like shellcode, powershell, VBScript, C#, Go, Mobile malware, etc As a final course assignment we were tasked on writting a report on any of the malware samples we were provided as course material, so here is mine: https://github.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last week I decided to try Matt Kiely&amp;rsquo;s Malware Analysis course published on TCM Security. I have always been curious about the inner workings of malware and this was the perfect opportunity for me to finally fulfill this knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the course was really well explained and the information really useful and to the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the different subjects explained in the course were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic Analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamic Analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decompiling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debugging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some specialty malware classes like shellcode, powershell, VBScript, C#, Go, Mobile malware, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final course assignment we were tasked on writting a report on any of the malware samples we were provided as course material, so here is mine:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JanDuinkerken/Malware-Analysis-Report&#34;&gt;https://github.com/JanDuinkerken/Malware-Analysis-Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested on this subject the first five hours of the course are availiable to watch for free on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA0YcYMRWyI&#34;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;, so go check them out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is a very good course and recommend it 100%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thats all for today, go check the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA0YcYMRWyI&#34;&gt;youtube video&lt;/a&gt; and have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
